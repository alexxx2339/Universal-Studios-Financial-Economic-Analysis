## 📈 Attendance Overview

| Park                     | 2017     | 2019 Peak | 2020 (COVID) | 2021     | 2022     | 2023 (↓)       |
|--------------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| *Universal Studios FL*   | 10.20 M  | 10.92 M   | 4.10 M       | 8.99 M   | 10.75 M  | **9.75 M (−9.3%)** |
| *Islands of Adventure*   | 9.55 M   | 10.38 M   | 4.01 M       | 9.08 M   | 11.03 M  | **10.00 M (−9.3%)** |

- Attendance dropped sharply in 2020 due to COVID‑19.
- Strong recovery followed in 2021–2022, although both parks did not fully return to peak levels.
- A modest decline of ~9.3% occurred in 2023, likely influenced by broader tourism and economic dynamics.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Strategy Recommendations

- International and group travel remained depressed post-pandemic, limiting growth potential.
- No major new attractions opened in 2023—delaying excitement before Epic Universe's 2025 launch.
- Rising ticket prices and summer heat likely dampened attendance during shoulder periods.
- Consideration for parks:
  - Offer **dynamic pricing or value packages**
  - Boost engagement with **off-season events** (e.g. early Halloween campaigns)
  - Increase **guest comfort amenities** and loyalty perks
